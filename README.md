# Exchange Hybrid Recipient Manager

A local web UI for managing Exchange Online recipients in a hybrid setup, for organisations
that have **decommissioned their last on-premises Exchange server** but still have
directory-synced objects whose mail attributes only Active Directory can change.

It runs entirely on your own machine: a PowerShell `HttpListener` serves the pages and calls
the Exchange Management Tools locally. There is no Exchange server, no IIS, no database and
no service to install.

## Why this exists

Remove your last Exchange server and the supported way to edit a synced user's proxy
addresses, remote routing address or GAL visibility is raw ADSI edits or hand-written
PowerShell. Microsoft's answer is the *Management Tools-only* install of Exchange 2019
(CU12+), which gives you `Get-RemoteMailbox`, `Set-RemoteMailbox` and friends without a
server. This puts a web UI on top of those cmdlets.

## What it manages

| Section | Actions |
|---|---|
| **Remote Mailboxes** | Enable a mailbox for an existing AD user; edit display name, alias and remote routing address; add and remove proxy addresses; hide from or show in the GAL; disable the remote mailbox |
| **Distribution Groups** | Create a group; mail-enable an existing AD group; edit display name and alias; mail-disable (keeps the AD group); delete |
| **Contacts** | Create, edit external address and display name, delete |
| **Email Address Policies** | Create with an address template, change priority and recipient filter, delete |
| **Accepted Domains** | Add, change domain type, delete |

Every list page has live search and sortable columns. Destructive actions sit behind a
type-to-confirm control that is **re-verified server-side** — the browser guard is treated
as a convenience, not a control.

## Requirements

- A domain-joined Windows machine with the **Exchange Server 2019 CU12 or later
  [Management Tools-only install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/manage-hybrid-exchange-recipients-with-management-tools)**
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 (the Exchange snap-in is not available in PowerShell 7)
- An account with Exchange recipient management rights
- Local administrator rights — the Exchange assemblies will not load without elevation

## Running it

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/SirTrek/ExchangeHybridRecipientManager.git
cd ExchangeHybridRecipientManager
.\Create-Shortcut.ps1        # optional: puts a shortcut on your Desktop
```

Then launch `Launch-ExchangeRecipientAdmin.bat`, or run the server directly:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Start-ExchangeRecipientAdminCenter.ps1
```

It picks a random localhost port, opens your browser, and logs each request to the console.
Click **Exit** in the UI to stop it.

## Security

The server **binds to `localhost` only and has no authentication of any kind**. That binding
is the entire access control model. Do not change it to `http://+:port/` or a machine name to
reach it from another computer: anyone who could reach that port could delete mailboxes,
delete accepted domains and break mail flow for whole namespaces, with no credentials. If you
need it from another machine, RDP to the machine running it, or install the Management Tools
where you actually want to work.

## Tests

```powershell
.\Test-ExchangeRecipientAdminCenter.ps1
```

102 assertions. It boots the real server script against stubbed Exchange cmdlets and drives
every route over real HTTP, so the whole request path is exercised rather than mocked. It
needs no Exchange, no Active Directory and no admin rights, and it never issues an LDAP query
— it is safe to run on the management box itself.

The stubs deliberately declare each cmdlet's **real parameter set** and nothing else, so
calling one with a parameter it does not have fails the way Exchange fails. Several genuine
bugs reached production precisely because an earlier, more permissive harness accepted
anything.

## Changes since the original

Beyond the features above, this fork fixes a number of defects in the original, several of
which caused silent data corruption:

- Values from Active Directory were substituted into HTML raw. A double quote in a display
  name truncated an input's `value` attribute, so opening a contact and saving silently
  renamed it; an apostrophe in a proxy address broke out of an inline `confirm('...')`
  string, which nulls the handler per spec and removed the confirmation prompt from a
  destructive action entirely.
- The query parser unescaped the whole query string *before* splitting it, so a `%3D` inside
  a value became a real delimiter — typing `a=b` in the SMTP box provisioned `a@domain` and
  reported success.
- `break` in the static-file branch exits the `switch`, not the file-serving block, so some
  requests returned the *previous* caller's page verbatim.
- `$HTMLRESPONSE`, `$HTML_RESULT` and `$Error` persisted across requests in the single
  long-lived loop scope, pinning stale banners — including outcome claims about destructive
  operations — onto later, unrelated page loads.
- Four modals posted to routes that did not exist, 404ing to a white page and discarding
  whatever had been typed. Edit pages for Contacts and Email Address Policies never existed;
  the Distribution Groups one existed under the wrong filename.
- `Set-AcceptedDomain -DomainName` is not a valid parameter, so changing a domain's type
  always failed. Email address policies could not be created without an address template, or
  updated when their priority was `Lowest`, and priorities outside Exchange's contiguous run
  were rejected with no guidance.
